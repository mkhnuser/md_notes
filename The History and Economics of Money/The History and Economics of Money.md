# The History and Economics of Money

## Overview

There is no single definition of what the term money means.

## The first Currencies

Barter exchange was the first thing to appear, it is ineffective, however.
Thus, the concept of money emerges - the common medium of exchange:

Here are some properties of money:

* Ease of transportation;
* Ease of division;
* Scarcity;
* They last a lot (not rotting, for example).

Metal money come to prevail in the shape of coins: coins have denominations since
they are standardized by their weight. The oldest coins were minted by private enterprises.
For one thing, the govs often were debasing money to go to war - they could hire more mercenaries.
The second thing is, they were afraid that private minters had too much power.

Here are the ways to debase metal money:

* Clipping the edges;
* Polishing.

## What makes good money?

Money has to be the most saleable good. In the medieval Europe, there were three types of coins:

* King Coins;
* Church Coins;
* Private Coins.

Churches were condemning money landing, but nonetheless were making loans.
Merchants develop the first concept of a ledger on the Silk Road.

## The Origins of Banking

The banking starts to emerge in the Renaissance age, and particularly in Italy.

The primary reason why banks charge an interest is because of the risk associated with landing and inflation; paper money emerges as a redeemable medium of exchange: you can always redeem your gold back, but at the same time you can start paying with paper money - it's more convenient.

Going further in time, bankers realize that a large amount of gold is idle in a vault,
so they start make profit off it by landing the gold.

The Bank of England, for example, was constituted to provide the gov interest at a low rate -
no other rights were given to it. Later, it became the only bank to issue banknotes and hold gold.

## Fall of Gold

During WW1, Britain stops redemption of gold to finance the war and not to raise taxes directly.
There was a huge amount of gold exported to the US from Europe during WW1.

## Rise of Fiat

Bretton Woods system establishes cooperation between the states.
After the WW1, many countries take their gold back from the US.

## Inflation

Inflation creates short-sightedness; it is a form of taxation.
