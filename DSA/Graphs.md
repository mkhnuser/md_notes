# Graphs

## Overview

Here are some examples of situations which can be modelled by graphs:

* Railroad network;
* Social network;
* Dependency graph;
* Planning graph.

## Representation of Graphs in Memory

### Adjacency Matrix

One can use edge weights as a matrix values too for a weighted graph.
Adjacency matrix requires O(V ** 2) space.

### Adjacency List

Adjacency List is another way to store a graph in memory.

## DFS

To avoid cycles in DFS, you color vertices: white, gray, black;
both recursive and iterative implementations are possible.

# TODO: Understand iterative solution which uses a stack.
