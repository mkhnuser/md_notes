# Sorting and Recursion

## Sorting

### Stable Sorting

Stable sorting refers to a property of a sorting algorithm
which states that given elements `a` and `b` and supposing their comparative elements
are equal and `a` appears before `b` initially, then after sorting `a` comes before `b`.

### In-place Sorting

An array to be sorted gets modified, no other array gets created.

## Recursion

One can use recursion to generate sequences of characters.
