# Functions

## Overview

Note that since each function is a relation,
each theorem which applies to relations also applies to a function.

## One-to-one functions

A horizontal line test can be used to determine whether a function is one-to-one or not.
Consider a semicircle, parabola, or a line, for example.

## Inverse functions

Inverse is symmetrical across `y = x` to the original function.

## Periodic Functions

Review proofs which require periods.

Important takeaway: it's important to separate functional definition from a functional "invocation";
f(2x) might represent a functional definition in one context;
and f(2x) might represent an argument 2x passed to the function in another context.
