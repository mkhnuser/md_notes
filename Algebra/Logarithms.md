# Logarithms

## Overview

Logarithms are defined only for positive numbers
since logarithmic functions are inverse functions for exponential ones.
Also, because logarithms are inverses to exponential functions,
bases of logarithms must be positive numbers not equal to one.

## Change of Base Rule

The reason why one might want to use the change of base rule is because
many calculators can only graph base-e and base-10 logarithms.

## Modulus is important

Section 5.4.
Exercise 51.
It's important to ensure that an argument to a logarithm function is always positive.
You use modulus for this.
This applies to any logarithm rule.
