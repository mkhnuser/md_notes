# Algebra

Remember that a function cannot be even if the set is not "symmetric": (5, 5], for example.

# Logarithms

Important restrictions: logs are defined only for pos. numbers.
Only pos. numbers which are not equal to 1 can be used as a base for a logarithm.

The reason why one might want to use the change of base rule is because
many calculators only graph base-e and base-10 logs.
