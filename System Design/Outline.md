2. Understand Load and Storage Requirements.

        1. MAU; DAU; READ / WRITE RATIO.
        2. The number of requests per month for read / write operations.
        3. RPS; QPS.
        4. Storage Requirements.
        5. Network Requirements.
        6. Storage Requirements for 5 years of work.
