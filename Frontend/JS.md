# JS

## Scope

The fact that you can use nested scoping is referred to as lexical scoping. Sometimes we call local vars as local binding (global vars as global binding).

## Comparison

Objects in JS are compared by identity, but not by their content. Moreover empty objects in JS are truthy.

## Functions

### Naming

One advantage of having named functions over anonymous ones is the convenience during debugging:
a function's name will be displayed.
