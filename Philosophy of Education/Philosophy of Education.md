# Philosophy of Education

## Overview

What shapes our views on Education? How was education effected by Philosophy?
These questions have no definitive answers, as it frequently happens.

## Classical Education in Ancient Greece

In Ancient Greece, for example, knowledge was passed largely orally,
without writing everything down, as we are used to. It's well known that Socrates,
for example, has not left any written records of his Philosophy. Almost everything we
know about his thoughts is due to Plato, his fellow student. As an antidote to Plato,
Aristotle should be mentioned. If Plato believed that a man's nature is largely corrupt
and that a higher authority should be invoked to hopefully save a man from ignorance
(Prisoners in a Cave), Aristotle was more optimistic by believing
that every man has an intrinsic inclination towards knowledge.
