# Philosophy of Education

## Overview

Below I try to succinctly summarize how our understanding of what education is has been developing.

## Classical Education in Ancient Greece

In Ancient Greece, for example, knowledge was passed largely orally,
without writing everything down, as we are used to. It's well known that Socrates,
for example, has not left any written records of his Philosophy. Almost everything we know about Socrates is due to Plato, his fellow student.

As an antidote to Plato's views on education, Aristotle should be mentioned. If Plato believed that a man's nature is largely corrupt and that a higher authority should be invoked to hopefully save a man from ignorance
(Prisoners in a Cave), Aristotle was more optimistic by believing
that every man has an intrinsic inclination towards knowledge.

## Religious Education

In Europe, Christianity starts to play an important role in education.
It was often perceived that to be educated, you have to know religious corpus.

St. Augustine believed that a religious education has to be enforced on a person by the state,
whereas Thomas Aquinas, some time later, believed that education has to be pursued by free choice.
One can clearly a distinction between these two approaches: St. Augustine was in favor of Platonic view on the human nature, whereas Thomas Aquinas was trying to incorporate Aristotle's view;
coercion vs free choice.

## Renaissance Education

An idea of a universal man starts to emerge: to be an educated person,
you have to be well-rounded individual, who is interested in math, art, poetry, music, etc.
The concept of self-directed learning starts is being constantly reinforced - one can do anything
he or she wants if they will.

## Education in the age of Enlightenment

The age of Enlightenment emphasized the use of science to examine the world,
rather than only following the religious doctrine. A separation between religion and science
is argued for: religion is for spirituality, science is for discovery.

John Locke, Galileo, Kant.

## Romanticism

Sometimes you need to reject science & progress and listen to your heart.

Rousseau.

## National Education (Prussian Model)

Prussians, after a defeat to the French in 1806, introduce state-wide education system,
which serves as a foundation for almost any other state-wide model nowadays.

Fichte.

## Progressivism

Truth is not objective but rather something that we believe in.

## The Montessori Method

What is there further for education? How can it be improved?
