HEAD is a pointer which either (points to a specific branch which in turns points to a specific commit) or (points to a specific commit directly [detached HEAD]).

A remote in Git is basically a remote URL with which you can communicate: make fetch, pull, push, etc. Usually you have only one remote called origin.
