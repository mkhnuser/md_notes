# Git

HEAD is a pointer which either (points to a specific branch which in turns points to a specific commit) or (points to a specific commit directly [detached HEAD]).

A remote in Git is basically a remote URL with which you can communicate: make fetch, pull, push, etc. Usually you have only one remote called origin.
A shorter syntax for git pull origin main is just git pull if a remote tracking branch in configured.

git config command by default applies to local level. Here are the levels: local, global, system.
