# Similar triangles

Bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side on segments which are proportionate to adjacent sides of the triangle. Conversely, if a segment divides the opposite side on segments which are proportionate to adjacent sides of a triangle, then the given segment is a bisector.

The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles equals the ratio of heights which are based on the corresponding sides.

The ratio of perimeters of two similar triangles equals the scale factor.

If an angle is intersected by two parallel lines such that you obtain segments a, b on one side of the angle and segments c, d on the other side of the angle (counting from the origin), then the segments a, b proportionate to segments c, d.

Varignon's Theorem: The figure formed by joining the midpoints of adjacent sides of a convex quadrilateral is always a parallelogram.

Suppose you are given a right triangle ABC with a right angle C. Suppose CH is a height which is based on the hypotenuse. Then the height CH equals the product of legs divided by the hypotenuse. The squares of the legs are proportionate to projections of the legs on the hypotenuse.
