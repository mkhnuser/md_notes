# Secrete formulas for calculating the surface areas

The surface area of a rhombus equals half the product of its diagonals. More generally, if the diagonals of a convex 4-gon are perpendicular, then the surface of this polygon equals half the product of its diagonals. 

The surface area of an equilateral triangle equals the side squared times the square root of three divided by 4.
