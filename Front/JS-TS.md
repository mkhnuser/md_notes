# JS and TS

We say that local variables are in local scope, whereas global vars are in global scope. The fact that you can use nested scoping is referred to as lexical scoping. Sometimes we call local vars as local binding (global vars as global binding).

Objects in JS are compared by identity, but not by their content. Moreover empty objects in JS are truthy.
